= Design Patterns

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_pattern[Design patterns]
have been recognized in a number of disciplines, including architecture and 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern[computer software].
So, it isn't surprising that there are some common patterns to be found in (say) data modeling and query formulation for graph databases.
Although many of these patterns are derived from graph theory and/or computer science, their motivation and implementation in Neo4j makes this more than a catalog of data structures and graph traversal algorithms.

This is an early attempt to recognize and describe some of these patterns.
If you like the idea, please help me to improve these pages, create new ones, and cross-reference them all to relevant GraphGists.

See the link:./?github-neo4j-contrib%2Fdesign-patterns%2F%2Fmeta%2FFormat.adoc[pattern format] and 
link:./?github-neo4j-contrib%2Fdesign-patterns%2F%2Fmeta%2FTemplate.adoc[pattern template]
pages for information (eg, ground rules, hints) on creating good descriptions.
