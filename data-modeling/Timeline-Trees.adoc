= Timeline Trees (Indexing)

Intent::

Timeline Trees provide tree-structured indexes for timelines
(ie, time-ordered sets of events), allowing them to be aggregated, searched, etc.

Also Known As::

NA

Motivation::

We have a sequence of events (eg, meetings).
We want to be able to find all of the meetings in a given month,
count the meetings in a given year, etc.

Applicability::

The date (and possibly time) for each event is known.

Structure::

Participants::

Nodes for the tree itself, temporal nodes (eg, specific years, months, days)
and time-bound event nodes.

Collaboration::

Each temporal node (eg, "June, 2014") has a relation from its parent (eg, "2014")
and relations to its children (eg, "June 21, 2014"), if any.
The bottom-level temporal node has relations to event nodes (eg, "GraphDB Meetup"), if any

Consequences::

A path of temporal nodes and connecting edges must be created to each event node.
Typically, many of these nodes and edges will be shared.

Implementation::
