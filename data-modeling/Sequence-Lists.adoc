= Sequence Lists (Traversal)

== Intent

Sequence Lists facilitate traversal of ordered nodes (eg, time-ordered sets of events).

== Also Known As

NA

== Motivation

We have a sequence of nodes (eg, meetings).
We want to be able to step directly from a given node
to the following (or previous) node.

== Applicability

The nodes have a known, unambiguous order.

== Structure

== Participants

Every node in the sequence

== Collaboration

Each node in the sequence has a relation to its predecessor and successor nodes, if any.

== Consequences

No additional nodes are created.
Assuming that the sequence has N nodes, N-1 edges are created.

== Implementation

TODO: A description of an implementation of the pattern; the solution part of the pattern.

== Sample Code

TODO: An illustration of how the pattern can be used in a programming language.

== Known Uses

TODO: Examples of real usages of the pattern.

== Related Patterns

TODO: Other patterns that have some relationship with the pattern;
discussion of the differences between the pattern and similar patterns.
